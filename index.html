    <h1>Welcome to my Stable Diffusion GitHub Page Demo!</h1>
    <p>
      This page is a demonstration of how to build and host a stable diffusion project that can run generative models in real time via a github page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was developed in google colab using a stable diffusion model from huggingface and the user interface library gradio. After being tested and styled it was uploaded to a huggingface space running a GPU for $0.6 / hour and then embedded as a dynamic html element on this static github page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradio is an amazing tool for quickly making user interfaces from python notebooks but it's fairly difficult to override it's default styling so this also demonstrates some basic css resetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual demo is a very basic use of stable diffusion to produce children's drawings from user input. It's kind of intended for my 2yo to play around with. It costs a little money to run this GPU so don't go too nuts! üôè‚ú®
